[Kevin][0] and I did a bit of mentoring yesterday with founders at [You Is Now][1], a startup accelerator run by [Scout24 Portals][2]. Scout24 bundles leading digital marketplaces for cars and real estate under one name, the most recognizable for us Berliners being ImmoScout.de. [Eywalk][3] and [VRnow][4] make up the current class, intentionally smaller than in the past to allow for more focused support from the corporate team.

Both startups were selected because their technologies represent innovations that are relatively close to the corporate development strategy. However they're also bleeding edge enough to be out of scope for the current product roadmap, so an accelerator approach allows Scout24 to watch the space with a low risk investment of â‚¬15,000 plus expenses for facilities. 

A challenging question that came out of the discussion was was how to apply lean strategies and "get out of the building" to confirm with customers that you have a minimum viable product when your technology is totally based on machine learning. We didn't come to a conclusion during the session and it's been on my mind.

Machine learning requires lots and lots of data to be inputted to the model before the outputs can result in a demonstrable product. In this case, the solution needed to come from the learning it would glean out of thousands of building blueprints and floor plans. This takes months and months of time and money before a potential customer can have something tangible enough to tell you if they'd pay for it.

We faced a similar challenge with [AVARI][5], a recommendation engine we built based on [predictive analytics][6] and machine learning. It captured front-end browsing behavior on a website and ran the data through algorithms that predicted what a person would want to see next. It then injected that content into individualized emails and tracked what images people clicked when they opened the email. Lastly, it closed the loop by learning what was enticing clicks and what wasn't, and applied that feedback to the predictive model. 

Even when we had achieved critical mass in terms of data and the tech was super smart, it was still very hard to demo the results. How do you show the relevance of an infinite number of variations to one person? They had to simply trust us.

I don't have a clear answer for earlier stage companies and what they should do when the machine learning outputs aren't ready yet, other than to try and focus on the problem being solved and have conceptual solution discussions with potential customers. For AVARI, we sort of faked it till we made it, and then we did a long, deep technology presentation to the acquiring company involving our whole engineering team when we sold it.
